<p><img src="/images/2016/transit-july-1.png" alt="Transit Boardings" title="Transit boardings" /></p>

<p>Monthly boardings on our regional transit system were up approximately 3.6% in the first five months of 2016, once again out-pacing employment and population growth. In all we had almost 2.7 million more boardings in the first five months of 2016 than we did in 2015 for a total of 76.9 million boardings through May 2016. If we look back over the past five years, transit ridership is up over 13% since May of 2011 with additional 8.9 million boardings in the first five months of 2016.</p>

<p>Boardings on all modes of public transit (bus, light rail, street car and commuter rail) have increased so far in 2016.</p>

<h4 id="light-rail-ridership-continues-to-climb-after-opening-of-new-stations">Light Rail Ridership continues to climb after opening of new stations</h4>

<p>Light rail boardings jumped significantly after the opening of the Capitol Hill and Husky Stadium Stations in March 2016 and ridership has continued to increase in the two full months following the March opening. Overall monthly boardings were up 798,000 on the region’s light rail and streetcar networks between May 2015 and May 2016, a 72% increase. Light rail boardings were up almost 5% between April and May of 2016.</p>

<p><img src="/images/2016/transit-july-2.png" alt="Transit Boardings" title="Light Rail boardings" /></p>

<h4 id="strong-growth-in-ferry-ridership">Strong Growth in Ferry Ridership</h4>

<p>Boardings on regional ferry routes have increased over 2015 levels for every month in 2016 so far for a total of 9.6 million boardings between January and May 2016, a 2.6% increase over 2015. This increase continues the trend of increasing ferry ridership that began in 2013 and represents a 9.5% ridership increase since 2010. Regional ferry ridership so far in 2016 is at its highest level since 2002.</p>

<p><strong>Figure 2. Ferry Boardings, January through May 2010 to 2016</strong>
<img src="/images/2016/transit-july-3.png" alt="Transit Boardings" title="Ferry Boardings" /></p>

<p>The ridership gains of the past three years follow nearly 10 years of flat or slowing declining ferry ridership as a result of various fare and route changes as well as shifting demographics in Kitsap County. Strong job growth as well as newer county provided passenger only service in the past 5 years is a likely reason for the recent growth in ferry ridership.</p>

<h4 id="why-do-transit-and-ferry-boardings-matter">Why do transit and ferry boardings matter?</h4>

<p>Transit and ferry boardings demonstrate how many people are traveling about the region in our transit system. The number of boardings can have impacts on the amount of traffic on our roads and the amount of ozone and carbon dioxide emitted into our air. A goal of our integrated land use and transportation plans is to increase the number of travel options available to people and to increase the amount of travel by modes other than the automobile. Transit and ferry boardings are one way to understand if more people are choosing these other travel options.</p>

<h4 id="whats-next">What’s next?</h4>

<p>The monthly transit trends were delayed a couple of months due to technical issues with the National Transit Database – a key source of consistent data used in the reporting of transit service and usage in these trends. These issues have been resolved and the data is back to its normal monthly publication cycle. In August we will have data through the first half of the year and we will be comparing transit growth between 2015 and 2016 with the changes in population and employment that we have reported on so far this year.</p>

<p>The region has gained 17,300 jobs since January - with 3,700 new jobs added in April 2016. The job growth since April 2015 has averaged 3.2%. King and Snohomish Counties continue to be the major contributors to regional job growth. Growth in April was slightly higher than the 3,300 jobs that were added to the region in March 2016.</p>

<p>The region gained added almost 63,000 jobs between April 2015 and April 2016, about 6% more than the 59,000 jobs added between April 2014 and April 2015.</p>

<p>The region has continued to experience robust job growth in the services sector by adding 3,500 more jobs in April 2016. The services sector includes jobs from IT, business services, recreation and food services etc. The services sector gained about 35,000 jobs over the past year, 13,000 more than it did between April 2014 and April 2015. The construction sector grew at 5.1%, the fastest annual growth rate between April 2015 and April 2016 while the manufacturing sector experienced slight job declines.</p>

<p>In March, PSRC kicked off the process to create a new Regional Economic Strategy for the Puget Sound Region. The new strategy will enhance understanding of the forces that drive the region’s economy, inform the region’s land use and transportation planning, and support state and local economic development initiatives. We will continue to examine job sector and other economic trends as the strategy is developed. For more information visit: http://www.psrc.org/econdev/res/.</p>

<p><img src="/images/2016/transit-april-1.png" alt="Transit Boardings" title="Transit boardings" /></p>

<p>Monthly boardings on our regional transit system were up a little more than 2% in the first two months of 2016. After a fairly flat January, ridership in February was up over 5% compared to 2015.   It should be noted that we did benefit from an extra day this February – but the estimated ridership from one extra day does not account for the overall increase of 5%.</p>

<p>All modes of public transit (bus, light rail, street car and commuter rail) were up in February 2016.</p>

<h4 id="how-do-we-compare-nationally">How do we compare nationally?</h4>

<p><strong>Figure 2. National Comparison of Transit Ridership</strong>
<img src="/images/2016/transit-april-2.png" alt="Transit Boardings" title="Transit Comparision" /></p>

<p>Transit Boardings in the Central Puget Sound Region have grown faster than any other Large Metropolitan Area in the United States since 2005.  In all, transit boardings have been growing at 3.6% per year since 2005 in our region. The next fastest growing area is Tampa-St Petersburg at around 3.1%. Our annual transit growth is 3 times faster than the Portland Metro region and our 185 million boardings in 2015 were the 8th highest out of the following 20 metropolitan areas.</p>

<h4 id="vanpool-capital-of-the-country">Vanpool capital of the country</h4>

<p><strong>Figure 3. Vanpool Usage</strong>
<img src="/images/2016/transit-april-1.png" alt="Transit Boardings" title="Vanpool" /></p>

<p>The Puget Sound Region continues to have the largest vanpool usage in the country – exceeding the next closest region of Los Angeles County by over 1 million vanpool trips a year. When you consider the relative population of the region – Los Angeles County is over 10 million people and we are about 3.9 million, our vanpool boardings per capita are almost three times higher than Los Angeles and the highest of any region in the country. The trend has continued into 2016 and vanpool usage in the first two months of 2016 is up slightly over 2015.</p>

<h4 id="coming-up-in-may">Coming up in May</h4>

<p>In May, we will see what ridership looked like in March - the first month of data with light rail serving Capitol Hill and the University of Washington. Although the majority of the month’s data will be prior to the light rail expansion, it should provide an initial glimpse at the change. It will also give us a glimpse at the totals for the first quarter of ridership in 2016.</p>

<p><strong>Figure 1. Passengers at SeaTac Airport</strong></p>

<p>There are many signs of a strong economy and vibrant quality of life in a region – and one of them is the amount of people who chose to travel to and from a region. It is estimated the over 75% of airline travel is for leisure but business related travel brings in a larger share of revenue to airlines – and this travel grows when the economy is growing.</p>

<h4 id="what-is-the-trend-for-airline-passenger-volumes-at-seattle-tacoma-international-airport">What is the trend for airline passenger volumes at Seattle-Tacoma International Airport?</h4>

<p>Seattle-Tacoma International Airport (SeaTac) was the 13th busiest airport in the United States last year and surpassed 42 million passengers for the first time in its history. In all, there were almost 5 million more passengers passing through the airport in 2015, a 13% increase over 2014.</p>

<p>In February 2016, an additional 364,000 passengers flew in and out of SeaTac airport, a 13.6% increase over February 2015, for a total monthly passenger volume of over 3.0 million. This marks the first time the airport has moved over 3 million people in the month of February and is 669,000 more passengers than February 2014.</p>

<h4 id="what-is-the-busiest-month-for-travel">What is the busiest month for travel?</h4>

<p>We all know that the week of Thanksgiving is the busiest week of the year at an airport but many people might be surprised to know that the summer months, especially July and August, are typically the busiest months for travel in the year. This reflects the summer travel that occurs throughout the month – unlike November which is pretty light for the first half of the month – as well as the fact that there are 31 days in each of those summer months.</p>

<p><strong>Figure 2. Annual Air Cargo at SeaTac Airport</strong></p>

<p>Over 330 metric tons of air cargo Air Cargo was moved through SeaTac airport in 2015 – up slightly from 2014 and ranking 19th in the country. Approximately 18% all air cargo moved is mail. February 2016 air cargo levels have reduced below 2015 levels and are slightly higher than the total amount of air cargo moved through the airport in February 2014.</p>

<p><strong>Figure 3. Passengers by Airline</strong></p>

<p>Alaska Airlines, which includes Horizon Air, carried over 55% of the passenger volume in February 2016. Delta Airlines is the next largest airline by passenger volume at approximately 18% of total passenger volume in February 2016. Delta Airlines has increased their market share 7% over the past two years and is currently the fastest growing carrier at Sea-Tac Airport – averaging 39% passenger volume growth per year on the last 2 years.</p>

<h4 id="whats-next">What’s Next?</h4>

<p>Passenger volume trends are updated monthly and will be considered along with other economic indicators to understand the story of growth in the region.</p>

<p><img src="/images/2016/delay-mar-1.png" alt="VHDelay" title="Vehicle Hours of Delay" /></p>

<p><strong>Figure 1. Vehicle Hours of Delay on the Freeway System</strong></p>

<p>Traffic congestion on our freeways increased in the first two months of 2016, but the rate of increase has moderated compared to last year. In all, commuters on our region’s freeways spent almost 1.7 million hours sitting in congestion over the first two months of 2016 – up 17% from the first two months of 2015. When you consider the cost of this delay in terms of lost time, extra fuel and general wear and tear on your vehicle, this delay totaled over $49 milliion dollars for the first two months of the year. This equates to a daily cost of delay of approximately $1.2 million dollars per weekday on freeways in our region.</p>

<h4 id="how-do-things-compare-by-corridor">How do things compare by corridor?</h4>

<p><strong>Figure 2. Vehicle Hours of Delay by Corridor</strong>
<img src="/images/2016/delay-mar-2.png" alt="VHDelay" title="Delay by Corridor" /></p>

<p>Overall, delay across freeway corridors has increased between 2015 and 2016 but there are noticeable differences by freeway. I-5 and I-405 account for approximately 90% of the regional delay on freeways. Of this, I-5 accounted for over 64% of the regional freeway delay in the first two months of 2016, up from approximately 61% in 2015. Delay on I-405 between Tukwila and Lynnwood dropped between 2015 and 2016 and now accounts for approximately 24% of the freeway delay (down from 30% in 2015). SR 520 was the other corridor in which delay in 2016 did not increase over 2015 levels.</p>

<p><img src="/images/2016/transit-march-1.png" alt="Transit Boardings" title="Transit boardings" /></p>

<p>Monthly boardings on Link Light Rail between SeaTac Airport and Downtown Seattle and Tacoma Link service between Tacoma Dome Station and Downtown Tacoma topped 1 million boardings in January 2016 – almost twice what the boardings were in January 2010. In all, January 2016 light rail boardings were 3.7% higher than January 2015.</p>

<p>Sound Transit’s Sounder Commuter Rail boardings also increased almost 4% between 2015 and 2016, increasing to over 325,000 monthly boardings in January 2016.</p>

<h4 id="what-about-buses">What about buses?</h4>

<p><img src="/images/2016/transit-march-2.png" alt="Transit Boardings" title="Bus boardings" /></p>

<p>January boardings on our region’s buses were down about 1% in January 2016 compared with January 2015, but still more than 7% higher than they were in January 2010. Boardings were down on all our operators except one, Community Transit, who experienced growth of approximately 1.5% between January 2015 and January 2016. King County Metro boardings were down around 0.5% and the largest drops were on Pierce and Kitsap Transit. Kitsap Transit was the only operator who had a reduction in service hours in January 2016.</p>

<p>There are several things to keep in mind when looking at monthly data – and for transit a big one is how many work days there are in the month. January 2016 had 21 weekdays in it, January 2015 had 22. One day doesn’t sound like much, but it resulted in 4.5% fewer workdays being observed in the monthly data in 2016.  All things considered, bus boardings were flat in January 2016.</p>

<h4 id="why-was-community-transit-up">Why was Community Transit up?</h4>

<p>The past several years of transit data have shown strong demand even when service hours have been down. One big difference for Community Transit this past January were service hours – up almost 10% in 2016. This increase reflects the re-addition of Sunday service to Community Transit that occurred in June 2015. This was the first of the additions for Community Transit – the first service increase related to the successful passage of the November 2015 ballot measure will go on-line in March 27th with even more service planned to come online in September 2016.</p>

<h4 id="coming-up-in-april">Coming up in April</h4>

<p>In April we will see what ridership looked like in February - the last month of data before the University Link opening. It will also include one extra day of ridership with our Leap Year.</p>

<p><img src="/images/2016/vmt-feb-1.png" alt="VMT" title="Vehicle Miles Traveled" /></p>

<p><strong>Figure 1. Daily Vehicle Miles Traveled</strong></p>

<p>“Vehicle Miles Traveled” is a measure that demonstrates how much people are traveling about the region. The amount of vehicle miles traveled has impacts on the amount of traffic on our roads and the amount of ozone and carbon dioxide emitted into the air. A goal of our integrated land use and transportation planning is to increase the number of travel options available to people and to lower the amount of vehicle miles traveled by automobile. Reducing the amount of miles driven per capita is an integral part of the State’s Climate Change Policy and a key part of the Region’s Four-Part Greenhouse Gas Strategy.</p>

<h4 id="what-are-overall-vehicle-miles-traveled-trends-in-our-region">What are Overall Vehicle Miles Traveled trends in our Region?</h4>

<p>The total annual vehicle miles traveled in the PSRC Region has remained fairly flat regionally since 2010, even though the region has been experiencing strong population and job growth since 2010. The daily miles driven per person was approximately 21.4 miles per person per day in 2014, levels last seen in the late 1980’s and below the peak of 24 miles per person per day in the late 1990’s. Regional data will not be available until the summer of 2016 but initial trends around the state show a possible increase in VMT occurred in 2015.</p>

<p><strong>Figure 2. Daily Vehicle Miles Traveled Per Person</strong>
<img src="/images/2016/vmt-feb-2.png" alt="VMT" title="Vehicle Miles Traveled Per Person" /></p>

<h4 id="what-about-the-state-as-a-whole">What about the state as a whole?</h4>

<p>Although VMT per Capita still remained below 2010 levels in 2015, there has been a fairly strong growth in miles traveled around the state in the past year. This growth in VMT can likely be attributed to our strong economy and population growth but also the cost of fuel. As shown in the figure below, VMT changes since 2010 around the state has mirrored the average cost of gas – with VMT generally increasing as the cost of fuel has decreased. The sharp drop in fuel prices in 2015 is likely a large indicator of the strong growth in VMT in 2015.</p>

<img src="/images/2016/vmt-feb-3.png" alt="VMT" title="Vehicle Miles Traveled Statewide" /></p>

<h4 id="what-are-future-implications">What are Future Implications?</h4>

<p>Low fuel prices and continued population and job growth looks to be increasing overall VMT over the past few years. VMT per capita remains below the highs of the late 1990’s but it will be important to return to  reductions in the amount of vehicle miles traveled per person to maintain our air quality and traffic congestions goals.</p>

<p><img src="/images/2016/ferry-ridership.png" alt="Ferries" title="Ferries" /></p>

<p><strong>Figure 1. Regional Annual Boardings by Ferry Operator</strong></p>

<p>Ferry Boardings are a measure that demonstrates how many people are traveling about the region on our region’s ferry system. The ferry system is an important access link to jobs, health care and recreation for citizens on both sides of Puget Sound. The Ferry system is also the only means of access to Vashon Island. There are currently four providers of ferry service in the region with county level service provided for passenger only service and the Washington State Ferries that serve both cars and walk on passengers.</p>

<h4 id="what-is-the-overall-ferry-trend-in-our-region">What is the Overall Ferry trend in our Region?</h4>

<p>Annual ridership on the Washington State Ferries (WSF) in the Puget Sound region increased in 2015 by almost 3%. This follows a 2.4% increase in 2014 and was the third straight annual increase after a long stretch of declining ridership dating back to 1999.  WSF ferry ridership in 2015 was 21.2 million distributed over six auto-routes, and each route had increasing ridership. The peak for regional ferry ridership was 24 million riders in 1999. Frequent fare increases, gas price hikes and the recent recession have contributed to a 12% ridership drop since that peak, recent gains notwithstanding.</p>

<p>Ferry ridership on the county provided service has experienced strong growth since 2006, growing almost 70%. County level operators have increased service frequency over this time period to meet the growing demand. A large part of this growth is on King County Ferry District service to Vashon Island and West Seattle. Overall annual boardings neared 1.2m on county provided service in 2015.</p>

<h4 id="how-did-ridership-vary-throughout-the-year-in-2015">How did ridership vary throughout the year in 2015?</h4>

<p>Ridership on the ferry system mixes commuters and recreational travelers. Ridership varies by month and by route but in general the highest ridership months for the ferry system are June through August. In these months the biggest increases in ridership occur on the routes that connect to the Kitsap Peninsula in Bremerton, Bainbridge Island and Kingston as well as Whidbey Island. Routes on and off of Vashon Island and the West Seattle Water Taxi tend to have more stable ridership patterns throughout the course of the year.</p>

<p><img src="/images/2016/ferry-monthly.png" alt="Ferries" title="Ferries" /></p>

<p><strong>Figure 2. Regional Annual Boardings by Month</strong></p>

<h4 id="how-did-mode-of-access-differ-by-route-in-2015">How did mode of access differ by route in 2015?</h4>

<p>Walk on passenger volumes vary greatly by route. The two largest walk-on volume routes serve Colman Dock in Downtown Seattle from Bremerton and Bainbridge Island. Bainbridge Island carried over 3 million walk-on passengers in 2015, approximately 49% of its total ridership. The Bremerton route carried over 1.6 million walk on passengers, 63% of its total ridership. Walk on trips made up roughly 10%-15% of the total annual ridership for the remaining WSF routes. Approximately 32% of all ferry passengers in the Puget Sound Region were walk on passengers in 2015.</p>

<p>Ferry service between Mukilteo and Clinton (Whidbey Island) carried more vehicles in 2015 than any other route followed closely by the Kingston-Edmonds route. In all, 89% of the total passengers on the Mukilteo-Clinton route access the ferry by automobile, the highest share of vehicle access in the system.</p>

<h4 id="what-are-the-future-implications">What are the Future Implications?</h4>

<p>Ferry routes will continue to connect the communities across the Puget Sound and are a critical link between people and the services they need. The more recent growth in both the supply and demand for passenger only ferry service will be important to understand as the region continues to grow.</p>

<p><strong>Figure 1. Annual Vehicle Hours of Delay on the Freeway System</strong></p>

<p>Did your trip to work in January seem even slower than usual? If so, you were not alone. Delay on our freeways increased 32% between January 2015 and January 2016. The increases were seen on all our freeways with the greatest change occurring on I-5 while congestion on I-405 increased the least (13%). In all, we spent an additional 211,000 hours in traffic over the 21 weekdays in January 2016.</p>

<h4 id="what-happened-in-2016">What happened in 2016?</h4>

<p>There are many things that factor into traffic congestion, but the biggest three in January 2016 were likely:</p>

<ol>
  <li>Construction closures on Hwy 99.</li>
  <li>53K jobs added over the past year.</li>
  <li>Rain, rain and more rain!</li>
</ol>

<p><img src="/images/2016/delay2.png" alt="VHDelay" title="Rain" /></p>

<p>Although each of these items likely led to our delay increase, it is very likely that Mother Nature had a big role in our congestion last month. It is estimated that approximately ½ of all congestion on our roadways is not related to how many people are trying to use them but is instead related to things that don’t happen every day – like collisions and vehicle breakdowns. Wet roadways can play a big part in the number of collisions that occur and thus can have a big impact on traffic congestion. In January 2016, over 70% of our weekdays had rain and over half of those had more than ¼” of rain.</p>

<h4 id="what-about-i-405">What about I-405?</h4>

<p><img src="/images/2016/delay3.png" alt="VHDelay" title="I-405" /></p>

<p>I-405 was unique compared to the other freeway corridors in January 2016 in that it had sections of the corridor that experienced increases in delay and others that had decreases in delay in 2016. Between Bellevue and Tukwila, the overall congestion on I-405 increased at a similar rate as many of the other freeways in the region. Between Bothell and Bellevue, the overall delay for all the freeway lanes decreased almost 60% compared to 2015 – the only large freeway corridor to see a reduction in delay in the region. North of Bothell, delays more than doubled between 2015 and 2016 – the largest percent increase for a corridor section in the region.</p>

<h4 id="region-starts-off-2016-by-adding-150-jobs-per-day">Region starts off 2016 by adding 150 jobs per day</h4>

<p>The region added 150 jobs per day, totaling 4,500 jobs in the first month of 2016. The majority of the job gains occurred in King and Snohomish Counties. The annual job growth rate remained around 3% in January 2016 despite a time when the retail sector traditionally ends seasonal holiday work. In December 2015, the region gained 5,200 jobs.</p>

<p>The region has continued to experience robust job growth in the past six years. The region has added 269,600 jobs since January 2010. The region gained 58,000 jobs since January 2015, which is 6% higher than 54,600 jobs added between January 2014 and January 2015. The regional civilian labor force increased 1.6% since January 2015 and the unemployment rate in January 2016 remained at 5.3%.</p>

<p>Park and ride lots provide a key access point for people into the regional transit network. Land use patterns throughout the region don’t always provide the necessary density to sustain frequent, all-day service.</p>

<p>Park and rides create an artificial density of transit riders, which provide the ridership necessary to fill peak-period transit service typically oriented toward commuters heading to major job destinations.</p>

<h4 id="what-does-the-trend-show">What does the trend show?</h4>

<p>As of December 2014, there were 120 permanent park and ride lots with 38,102 parking spaces and 101 leased park and ride lots with 4,752 spaces in the region. Permanent park and rides are usually larger and are publicly owned or have long-term agreements in place to provide parking for public transportation users. Leased park and rides are typically smaller than permanent park and rides with parking that goes underutilized during the week (e.g. church parking lots).</p>

<p><img src="/images/2016/pnr-capacity.png" alt="ParkAndRideLotCapacity" title="Park and Ride Lot Capacity" /></p>

<p>This chart shows the total capacity of permanent park and ride lots between 2001 and 2014. The region has added more than 17,000 parking spaces since 2001. There were noticeable increases in parking capacity in 2002, 2006, and 2009. Since 2011, however, the total number of parking spaces has actually decreased by 573 spaces.</p>

<p><strong>Permanent Park and Ride Lot Utilization, 2001-2014</strong>
<img src="/images/2016/pnr-utilization.png" alt="ParkAndRideLotUtilization" title="Park and Ride Lot Utilization" /></p>

<p>This chart shows the total utilization of permanent park and ride spaces between 2001 and 2014. The utilization rate in 2001 was 78%, a rate that wasn’t achieved again until 2008 when the utilization rate hit 80%. Between 2001 and 2008, 16,000 additional park and ride stalls came online. The utilization rate declined in 2009, likely owing to the effects of the recession. With the regional economy recovering, so has the park and ride utilization rate, which hit 81% in 2014.</p>

<img src="/images/2016/pnr-subarea.png" alt="ParkAndRideLotCapacityBySubarea" title="Park and Ride Lot Capacity by Subarea" /></p>

<p>This chart shows the total capacity of permanent park and ride lots by regional subarea between 2001 and 2014. Of the 17,201 parking spaces added since 2001, almost 16,000 were in the East King County (4,521), South King County (4,511), Snohomish County (3,780), and Pierce County (3,066) subareas. As of 2014, South King County (10,208) and East King County (8,855) have the most permanent park and ride spaces in the region, followed by Snohomish County (8,324) and Pierce County (6,675). The North King County subarea had 3,279 permanent park and ride spaces in 2014, which is actually a smaller number than it had in 2002 (3,451). There were only 761 permanent park and ride spaces in Kitsap County in 2014.</p>

<p><strong>Permanent Park and Ride Occupancy Rates, 2006-2014</strong>
<img src="/images/2016/pnr-occ-rates.png" alt="ParkAndRideLotOccupancyRates" title="Park and Ride Occupancy Rates" /></p>

<p>This chart shows how utilization of permanent park and ride spaces varies throughout the region. The highest utilization rate in 2014 occurred in the East King County (96%) and North King County (93%) subareas. The regional utilization rate of 81% in 2014 is right in line with the utilization rate in the Pierce County (82%) and Snohomish County (81%) subareas. South King County and Kitsap County have utilization rates of 66% and 65%, respectively, suggesting</p>

<h4 id="future-implications">Future implications</h4>

<p>The total number of permanent park and ride spaces has been largely the same since 2009, increasing a total of 0.4% or 149 spaces. The utilization rate, on the other hand, has steadily increased over that time from 72% to 81%. Constructing new permanent park and rides or adding significant numbers of spaces to existing lots is neither cheap nor quick. The only considerable increase expected in the next year will occur when 1,050 spaces come online when the Angle Lake Station opens as part of the Link light rail expansion in fall 2016.</p>

<p>The lack of growth will put increasing pressure on those lots that are already full and exacerbate existing challenges associated with these places: overcrowded lots that fill very early in the morning, congested local streets surrounding these facilities, and crush-loaded trains and buses that bypass riders down the line, filled with riders who commute early not out of convenience or need, but simply to get a parking space.</p>

<p>Ensuring that the region’s infrastructure is maintained and preserved in a safe and usable condition is the top priority in the regional transportation plan and comprises nearly half of the investment included in Transportation 2040.  Bridge conditions measure the safety, usability, and overall condition of bridges over 20 feet in length within the region.</p>

<p>Safe bridge crossings facilitate the movement of people and goods across the region’s many valleys, lakes, creeks, rivers, and other infrastructure.  When bridges are not properly maintained consequences include weight restrictions and wholesale closures, which can have significant impacts on the ability for freight and people to efficiently use the transportation system.</p>

<h4 id="what-is-the-overall-bridge-condition-trend-in-our-region">What is the Overall Bridge Condition trend in our Region?</h4>

<p>Figure 1 depicts the percentage of bridge deck area classified as in good, fair, and poor condition for the entire region as well as local, and state owned facilities, based on analyses defined by the Federal Highway Administration and Washington State Department of Transportation.  While individual bridges may have changed categories based on work performed over the last year, the overall system condition has stayed consistent with slightly over 90% of facilities falling within the “good” to “fair” range, and only 10% of facilities falling within the “poor” category.</p>

<p><strong>Figure 1. Regional Bridge Conditions</strong></p>

<p><img src="/images/2015/bridges-1.png" alt="RegionalBridgeConditions" title="Central Puget Sound Region Bridge Conditions" /></p>

<table><tr>
<td style="padding:10px;" valign="top"><font color="green">Good</font> : Bridges in good condition range from those with no problems to those having some minor deterioration of structural elements.</td>

<td style="padding:10px;" valign="top"><font color="#cc4">Fair</font> : Primary structural elements are sound; may have minor section loss, deterioration, cracking, spalling, or scour. This is the most cost-effective time to rehabilitate before the underlying structure is damaged.</td>

<td style="padding:10px;" valign="top"><font color="red">Poor</font> : A bridge in poor condition has advanced deficiencies such as section loss, deterioration, scour, or seriously affected structural components, and may have weight restrictions.  A bridge in poor condition is still safe for travel.</td>
</tr></table>

<p><br /></p>

<p>The same consistency holds relatively true when examining the trend for both local and state owned facilities independently. Local facilities (as defined by bridge deck area) in good or fair condition have increased approximately by 2% while state owned facilities have declined by approximately by 1%.  Looking ahead, percentage of state bridge deck area classified as good or fair is expected to increase considerably over the next few years due to the replacement of the Alaskan Way Viaduct and SR 520 floating bridge, which comprise a large portion of square footage that has been classified as “poor”.</p>

<h4 id="structurally-deficient-bridges">Structurally Deficient Bridges</h4>

<p>Structurally deficient bridges are those that rate very poorly in one or more of the critical elements of a bridge (bridge deck, superstructure, substructure, or culvert).  A facility can also be designated as such if its load carrying capacity is significantly lower than current design standards or the waterway below frequently overtops the bridge during floods.  This differs from functional obsolescence in that structurally deficient bridges are classified based on their physical condition whereas functionally obsolete bridges are identified as such based on key design elements relative to the current use of the facility.  For example, lanes too narrow for traffic or a misalignment of the bridge approaches.</p>

<p><img src="/images/2015/bridges-2.png" alt="StructurallyDeficient" title="Local and State Percent of Bridges Identified as Structurally Deficient" /></p>

<p>In 2015, structurally deficient bridge facilities represent just over 9% of the approximately 40.1 million square feet of bridge deck in the region, holding steady from 2014. Taking a closer look, locally-owned structurally deficient facilities represent 12% of the total local bridge deck area whereas state owned facilities classified as structurally deficient represent 9% of total state owned bridge deck area in the region. This is a similar relationship to 2014, where local structurally deficient local bridges made up 13% of the total local bridge deck area and state owned structurally deficient bridges represented 9% of state-owned bridge deck area. The gap between the two years appears to be shrinking. Figure 2 depicts the trends for, and the relationship between, locally and state bridges classified as structurally deficient.</p>

<h4 id="federal-requirements">Federal Requirements</h4>

<p>MAP-21 implemented minimum condition standards for structurally deficient facilities on the National Highway System, limiting the square footage of facilities classified as such to 10% of all bridge deck area on the NHS within the state.</p>

<p>Figure 3 depicts structurally deficient bridge deck area on the National Highway System within the region.  The analysis confirms that bridges on the NHS within the central Puget Sound region fall within the parameters outlined in MAP-21 at 9.9%, up slightly from 9.7% in 2014.</p>

<p><img src="/images/2015/bridges-3.png" alt="StructurallyDeficient" title="Bridges Classified as Structurally Deficient on the National Highway System within the Central Puget Sound Region" /></p>

<p>As work on the Alaskan Way Viaduct and SR 520 floating bridges is completed these percentages will drop significantly, as these are also two of the largest structurally deficient bridge facilities in the state.</p>

<h4 id="what-are-future-implications">What are Future Implications?</h4>

<p>For the time being, bridge conditions are holding steady; however, as WSDOT and local agencies continue to face budget shortfalls an increasing percentage of available resources will be required to maintain and improve upon these conditions.</p>

<p>VISION 2040 calls for the region to focus future housing and employment growth within regionally and locally designated centers (see MPP-DP-5). PSRC has designated 29 Regional Growth Centers as locations for compact, pedestrian-oriented development, with a mix of different office, commercial, civic, entertainment, and residential uses. Attracting more new housing within centers is one important element of success in implementing regional growth strategy.</p>

<p>Providing housing choices in centers means that more people have the opportunity to live close to jobs, services, and urban amenities, both within walking distance of their homes and via transit connections to other centers of activity in the region. Easy and affordable access to such opportunities, which is furthered by locating housing in centers, is especially important to low-income households.</p>

<h4 id="what-are-the-trends-in-the-region">What are the trends in the region?</h4>

<p>Figure 1 shows the growth in the amount of housing and housing development over time as a share of the region’s overall housing growth. Over time, more of the region’s housing stock has been located within Regional Growth Centers. Figure 1 shows growth in the overall share of housing in centers. In the year 2000, 6.3% of housing was in centers. By 2010, this figure had increased to 7.2%, with further growth to 7.6% of the region’s housing units located in centers in 2014.</p>

<p><img src="/images/2015/housing-in-centers.png" alt="HousingInCenters" title="Housing Units in Regional Growth Centers" /></p>

<p>Figure 1 also shows an upward trend in the share of the region’s housing growth occurring in centers. From 2000 to 2010, 12.5% of all housing added in the region was located in Regional Growth Centers. This capture rate is double the baseline share of 6.3%. From 2010 to 2014, the capture rate for housing in centers increased even further to 19%, which means that currently, nearly one in five new units built in the region is inside a center.</p>

<p>Figure 2 shows the distribution of new and existing units in centers across the region. In the year 2000, the region’s centers contained approximately 83,000 units of housing. Since 2000, the region’s centers have added nearly 37,000 net new housing units, for a total of more than 120,000 units in the year 2014. New housing in centers is highly concentrated in about a third of the 29 Regional Growth Centers, located in five cities: Seattle, Renton, Redmond, Bellevue, and Tacoma.</p>

<p><strong>Figure 2. Regional Growth Centers and Manufacturing/Industrial Centers</strong></p>

<p><img src="/images/2015/regional-growth-centers-map.png" alt="GrowthCenters" title="Regional Growth Centers and Manufacturing/Industrial Centers" /></p>

<p>Another third of the centers have seen modest housing growth, but at a far lower level. The bottom third of centers has experienced little or no housing development, capturing less than 10% of the residential growth in their respective cities.</p>

<h3 id="what-are-the-future-implications">What are the future implications?</h3>

<p>The more that the region can achieve a “significant share” of housing growth within regional centers, as called for in MPP-DP-5, the greater will be the benefits to the region as a whole and to the region’s current and future households who may prefer to reside in centers. The Regional Growth Strategy calls for cities with Regional Growth Centers to capture more than half of the region’s population growth by 2040.</p>

<p>The current trend is moving in the right direction. However, even more of the region’s housing will need to locate in centers over time, especially in those centers that have not experienced much housing development, in order to achieve the regional vision of compact development in central places. Success will mean enhanced support for our transit network, a healthier environmental, focused investment and economic development, and better access to opportunities for all types of households.</p>

<p>Access to affordable housing is a basic community need. The cost of owning a home compared with income is one important measure of access to affordable housing in the central Puget Sound region.</p>

<p>A shortage of affordable ownership housing can impact transportation, as households are forced to purchase homes far from places of employment, as well as the regional economy, by making it harder to attract and retain workers. Homeownership helps to promote long-term housing stability for families, wealth building opportunities for community residents, and can lead to emotional investment of residents in the neighborhood. VISION 2040 prioritizes developing strategies to ensure affordable homeownership for low- to moderate-income households. Home price is one indicator of the sufficiency of existing land use plans to accommodate market demand for the growth that region is experiencing.</p>

<p><img src="/images/2015/affordability-median-family-buyer.png" alt="Median Family Affordability" title="Median Family Affordability" /></p>

<h4 id="what-are-the-trends-in-the-region">What are the trends in the region?</h4>

<p>Figure 1 shows affordability trends across the region relative to the median family income. The annual measure of affordability is indicated as an Affordability Index, which produced by the Central Puget Sound Real Estate Research Center from the Runstad Center for Real Estate Studies at the University of Washington. The index is a relative measure that compares income to monthly owner payments. A score of 100 indicates that a household earning the median family income can afford to purchase a median price home. A higher score means that relatively more of the homes on the market are affordable at the median income level; a lower score means that the proportion of affordable homes is more constrained. This benchmark tells us how middle-income households are faring in the homeownership market.</p>

<p>The affordability trend is similar across the region’s counties. Affordability declined during the middle part of the last decade, improved as a result of the bursting of the real estate bubble during the last recession, and again is declining as price increases outstrip average incomes. Owning a home is most expensive, relative to income, in King County, and relatively more affordable in the other counties, especially Kitsap and Pierce counties.</p>

<p>Figure 2 shows the Affordability Index calculated for households that fit the profile of a typical first-time homebuyer. The index, which is also produced by the Real Estate Research Center, is calculated based on a lower income level (70% of median family income) and a lower home price (85% of median home price) and less down payment. Like the overall Affordability Index, a score of 100 indicates that a household earning this income could afford to purchase such a home. A higher score indicates more affordability options for the typical first-time buyer; a lower score indicates fewer of the homes on the market affordable to first time buyers.</p>

<p><img src="/images/2015/affordability-first-time-buyer.png" alt="First-Time Homebuyer Affordability" title="First-Time Homebuyer Affordability" /></p>

<p>The index shows that housing is much less affordable for a first-time buyer than for all buyers. A comparison with Figure 1 shows that the Affordability Index for buyers overall generally has remained above the benchmark score of 100, while the First-Time Homebuyer Index has generally remained well below 100. Like the overall index, affordability for first time homebuyers declined during the housing bubble of the last decade, improved during the subsequent recession, and has recently begun to decline again. King County is the least affordable county for first time buyers.</p>

<h4 id="why-do-transit-boardings-matter">Why do Transit Boardings matter?</h4>

<p>Transit Boardings is a measure that demonstrates how many people are traveling about the region in our region’s transit system. The transit system includes bus, commuter rail, light rail, streetcar and vanpool. The number of boardings can have impacts on the amount of traffic on our roads and the amount of ozone and carbon dioxide emitted into our air. A goal of our integrated land use and transportation plans is to increase the number of travel options available to people and increase the amount of travel by modes other than the automobile.</p>

<h4 id="what-are-overall-transit-boarding-trends-in-our-region">What are Overall Transit Boarding trends in our Region?</h4>

<p>Figure 1 shows the total annual transit boardings in the PSRC Region since 2006. Despite impacts to the overall level of transit service in the region, region wide transit ridership has grown steadily since 2010 and exceeded 185 million annual boardings in 2014. Overall annual regional transit boardings have increased by over 39M annual boardings since X, a 23% increase. Transit boardings have exceeded pre-recession levels despite fewer service hours in 2014 than 2010 which has lead to higher standing volumes on buses and trains. In 2014, 25% of all ST express bus trips had passengers standing.</p>

<h4 id="how-does-the-service-compare-to-2006">How does the Service compare to 2006?</h4>
<p>The Great Recession had immediate impacts on transit boardings that have now been erased but it continues to affect the amount of service provided to passengers. Despite regional boardings being up over 23% since 2006, overall transit service in 2014 is still slightly less than it was in 2008.. Transit fares have also been increased by all operators over this time period.</p>

<p><img src="/images/2015/mode-table.png" alt="Boardings Table" title="Boardings Table" /></p>

<h4 id="what-about-rail">What about Rail?</h4>

<p>Rail, which includes light rail, streetcar and commuter rail has grown in frequency and coverage since 2006 which has resulted in significant increases in rail boardings since 2006. In 2006, Tacoma Link Light Rail and Sounder were the only rail services in the region and carried about 2% of the region’s total transit boardings each day. In 2009, Central Link started service and by 2014 rail boardings make up almost 10% of all daily transit boardings in the region.</p>

<p><strong>Figure 2. Regional Rail Boardings</strong>
<img src="/images/2015/rail.png" alt="Rail" title="Rail Boardings" /></p>

<h4 id="what-are-the-future-implications">What are the Future Implications?</h4>

<p>Increases in transit boardings are consistent with regional policy. As the population continues growing, it will be important to maintain transit service levels to meet an increasing demand on the system. Moving forward we will be reporting on transit crowding measures like passenger loads to understand how the system is working for all users.</p>

<p><strong>Figure 1. Annual Vehicle Hours of Delay on the Freeway System</strong></p>

<h4 id="why-does-measuring-vehicle-hours-of-delay-and-estimated-cost-of-delay-matter">Why Does Measuring Vehicle Hours of Delay and Estimated Cost of Delay Matter?</h4>

<p>Vehicle Hours of Delay on the freeway system is a measure that demonstrates how much extra time is spent traveling on the region’s freeways due to congestion. Increased delay has an impact on the movement of both people and goods and stop and go traffic has negative impacts on air quality in the region. Delay is measured against a maximum throughput speed of 50MPH on a freeway segment.</p>

<p>Annual cost of vehicle delay is the economic impact to drivers and businesses based on lost productive time, wasted fuel and additional vehicle maintenance costs due to extra time spent in traffic. The cost of vehicle delay is calculated by applying a monetary value to the estimated hours of delay incurred by passenger and truck travel plus additional vehicle operating costs.</p>

<h4 id="what-is-the-overall-trend-in-the-central-puget-sound-region">What is the Overall Trend in the Central Puget Sound Region?</h4>

<p>Annual vehicle hours of delay on freeways in the PSRC Region since 2010 are highlighted in Figure 1. The corridors included in the bar chart include I-5 from DuPont to Marysville, I-405, SR 167, I-90 from Seattle to Issaquah, SR 520, SR 3 and SR 16.  Vehicle hours of delay have increased over 50% since 2010 with the greatest increases experienced in 2014. Truck delays make up approximately 7.5% of the total delay experienced on the freeway system. There were nearly 9.5M hours of delay experienced in the region in 2014 on the freeway system.</p>

<p>The rapid increase in delay has had impacts on all users of the transportation system including the transit agencies whose buses rely on the arterial and freeway system to move passengers about the region. Rapid increases in delay have increased the number of buses running late and make it more difficult to plan and deliver reliable schedules for service. In 2014 almost 25% of all Community Transit commuter routes operating along I-5 were considered late.</p>

<p>Figure 2 highlights the cost of this congestion in terms of an economic impact to drivers and businesses in terms of lost productivity, wasted fuel and additional vehicle maintenance costs due to extra time spent in traffic. In 2014 this cost was estimated to be over $280M with almost 22% of that cost bore by the freight users in the system. By contrasting vehicle hours of delay with estimated congestion costs on the freeway system, it becomes apparent that there are differences in the way that congestion impacts freight and commercial travel compared to personal travel that may be worth further examination.</p>

<p><strong>Figure 2. Annual Cost of Delay on the Freeway System</strong>
<img src="/images/2015/delay2.png" alt="DelayCost" title="Cost of Delay on Freeways" /></p>

<p>It is anticipated that annual vehicle hours of delay will be one of the measures remaining to be finalized under MAP 21 rulemaking.  For PSRC, vehicle hours of delay is one of a number of measures that are examined as part of updates to the Congestion Management Process, and Transportation 2040.</p>

<p><strong>Figure 1. Regional Vehicle Miles Traveled</strong></p>

<h4 id="why-do-vehicle-miles-traveled-matter">Why do Vehicle Miles Traveled matter?</h4>

<p>“Vehicle Miles Traveled” is a measure that demonstrates how much people are traveling about the region. The amount of vehicle miles traveled has impacts on the amount of traffic on our roads and the amount of ozone and carbon dioxide emitted into the air. A goal of our integrated land use and transportation plans is to increase the number of travel options available to people and to lower the amount of vehicle miles traveled by automobile. Reducing the amount of miles driven per capita is an integral part of the State’s Climate Change Policy and a key part of the Region’s Three-Part Climate Change Program.</p>

<h4 id="what-are-overall-vehicle-miles-traveled-trends-in-our-region">What are Overall Vehicle Miles Traveled trends in our Region?</h4>

<p>Figure 1 shows the total annual vehicle miles traveled in the PSRC Region as well as daily miles driven per person since 1980. The total vehicle miles traveled has remained fairly flat regionally since the late 1990’s. The daily miles driven per person have dropped to levels last seen in the late 1980’s. This has occurred even though the region has grown by over 1.5 million people since 1980.</p>

<ul>
  <li>Regional miles driven decreased from 29.8B in 2006 to 29.6B in 2013 despite the population increasing by over 240K people (a 9% increase).</li>
  <li>Regional miles driven per person decreased from a peak of 24 miles per person in 1999 to 21.5 miles per day in 2013.</li>
</ul>

<h4 id="what-are-the-future-implications">What are the Future Implications?</h4>

<p>The drop in vehicle miles traveled is consistent with the outcome “Travel by alternatives to driving alone is increased”. As the population continues growing, it will be important to maintain reductions in the amount of vehicle miles traveled per person to maintain our air quality and traffic congestions goals.</p>

<p><strong>Figure 1. Regional Annual Boardings by Ferry Operator</strong></p>

<h4 id="why-do-ferry-boardings-matter">Why do Ferry Boardings matter?</h4>

<p>Ferry Boardings count how many people are traveling on our region’s ferry system. The ferry system is an important access link to jobs, health care and recreation for citizens on both sides of the Puget Sound. The ferry system is also the only means of access to Vashon Island. There are currently four providers of ferry service in the region with county level service provided for passenger only service and the Washington State Ferries that serves both cars and walk on passengers.</p>

<h4 id="what-is-the-overall-ferry-trend-in-our-region">What is the Overall Ferry trend in our Region?</h4>

<p>Figure 1 shows the total annual ferry boardings in the PSRC Region since 2006. Washington State Ferries (WSF) carries the largest share of ferry traffic of all ferry providers. Over this period, boardings on the Washington State Ferry System have reduced slightly with total annual boardings in 2014 of approximately 23.1 million. The population of Kitsap County has grown the least since 2006 and is increasing in age quicker than the other three counties in the PSRC region, one reason why the boardings on the ferry have decreased over this time period. There have also been a variety of fare and service changes that have also played a role in the changes in the overall demand for ferry service provided by WSF. WSF has been experiencing a growth in ferry boardings since about 2012.</p>

<p>Ferry ridership on the county provided service has experienced strong growth since 2006, growing almost 70% County level operators have increased service frequency over this time period to meet the growing demand. A large part of this growth is on King County Ferry Division service to Vashon Island and West Seattle. Overall annual boardings topped 1.1m on county provided service in 2014.</p>

<h4 id="what-are-the-future-implications">What are the Future Implications?</h4>

<p>Ferry routes will continue to connect the communities across the Puget Sound and are a critical link between people and the services they need. The more recent growth in both the supply and demand for passenger only ferry service will be important to understand as the region moves forward.</p>
